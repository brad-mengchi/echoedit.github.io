# Introduction

The glloader is a subproject of KLay Game Engine. I wrote the information here is to notes for glloader source code and functionalities.

glloader orginal Wiki: http://www.klayge.org/wiki/index.php/Glloader/en

# Dir Structure

* Build/cmake: glloader and glloader_es CMakeLists
* autogen.py: auto generate script for loading code
* xml: registery specification

# OpenGL Registery and XML

XML specs maintain glloader registery by typedefs, tokens and functions. autogen.py will be used to generate source(glloader_gl.c) and header file(glloader_gl.h) according to XML.

glloader first use LOAD_FUNC1/2 macro to load GL functions from dynamic library according to different platfrom and then invoke them.

# Dynamic Loading

Windows uses LoadLibraryExA and GetProcAddress and *nix uses dlopen and dlsym to load library and function dynamically.

# Summary

glloader provides cross platform encapsulation to load OpenGL dynamic library.
